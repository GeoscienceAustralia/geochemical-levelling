# Geochemical-levelling

Levelling of geochemical data between surveys is a vital step in using datasets together. This code can apply a number of approaches to eliminate inter-laboratory differences from multi-generational and spatially isolated geochemical surveys. This codes allow the use of a variety of levelling methods: re-analysis, single standards, and multiple standards. The methodology and effectiveness of each of these methods are outlined in Main, P.T. and Champion, D.C., 2022. Levelling of multi-generational and spatially isolated geochemical surveys.
